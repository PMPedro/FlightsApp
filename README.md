# FlightsApp

**FlightsApp** is a modern Android application built to demonstrate a clean UI, asynchronous operations, and integration with Firebase. The app allows users to browse flights and simulate bookings using mock data. **This project is still in development.**


## ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools
- **Kotlin** & **Jetpack Compose** for modern UI development  
- **Kotlin Coroutines** for asynchronous tasks  
- **Firebase** for authentication  
- **Mock API** for flight data simulation  
- **Material 3** for design system and theming

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
This project is designed to help me:  
- Practice building **modern, reactive Android UIs** with Jetpack Compose  
- Implement **state management** using `MutableState` and `StateFlow`  
- Work with **asynchronous operations** using Coroutines  
- Integrate **Firebase authentication**  
- Structure a project using **clean, modular architecture**  
- Create a **polished portfolio-ready app** while demonstrating incremental development

## âš¡ Current Status
- âœ… Login and Sign Up UI  
- âœ… Wave animation background  
- âšª Flight listing and search (in progress)  
- âšª Booking simulation (planned)  
- âšª Persistent user data (planned)  

> This project is a work in progress. More features, screenshots, and demos will be added as development continues.
